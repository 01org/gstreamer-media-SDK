  GStreamer-MSDK
  Media SDK plugins for GStreamer

Overview
--------

GStreamer-MSDK consists of a collection of Media SDK-based plugins for
GStreamer.

  * `mfxdecode' is used to decode H.264 AVC, MPEG-2, HEVC, VC-1 and
    JPEG videos using the underlying hardware capabilities. 

  * `mfxsink' is used to render the decoded frame to a Wayland / X11
    display.

  * 'mfxvpp' is used to do video processing on RAW surfaces.

Features
--------

  * Decode H264 AVC, MPEG-2, JPEG, VC-1, HEVC, and VP8 Videos
  * Support for the Wayland and X11(with EGL backend)display server
  * Support for headless decode pipelines
  * Support MediaSDK video processing capabilities

Requirements
------------

Software requirements

  * Media SDK 2016 R1 for Yocto Embedded (MediaSDK2016R1forYoctoEmbedded-Alpha2.tar.gz) or
    Media Server Studio 2016 Professional R1 (Haswell)
  * GStreamer 1.4.x (up to including GStreamer 1.6):
  * GStreamer-Plugins-Base 1.4.x (up to including GStreamer 1.6):
  * CMake
  
  * Renderers:
      Wayland (>=1.7)
      X11 (With EGL backend)
      EGL

Hardware requirements

  * Intel Apollo Lake
  * Intel Braswell
  * Intel Haswell / Broadwell

Compiling
---------

GStreamer-MSDK uses the CMake build tool to build the plugins.
Create a build directory within the source directory and run the CMake
command to configure the build.

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	
Next step is to compile the GStreamer-MSDK plugins:

	make

To install the plugins:

        make install

The plugins will be installed in the /usr/lib64/gstreamer-1.0 directory.

Usage
-----

  * Play an H.264 video with an MP4 container
  $ gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=/path/to/video.mp4 ! \
      qtdemux ! h264parse ! mfxdecode ! mfxsink

Known Issues
-----------

  * Decode for VC-1 Advance Profile bitstream is not working.
