GStreamer-MSDK
==============
  MediaSDK plugins for GStreamer


Overview
--------

GStreamer-MSDK consists of a collection of Media SDK-based plugins for
GStreamer.

  * 'mfxdecode' is used to decode H.264 AVC, MPEG-2, HEVC, VC-1, VP8 and
    JPEG videos using the underlying hardware capabilities. 

  * 'mfxsink' is used to render the decoded frame to a Wayland / X11
    display.

  * 'mfxvpp' is used to do video processing on decoded or RAW video frames.

  * 'mfxvc1parse' is used to parse VC-1 Simple, Main and Advance profiles.

  * 'mfxh264enc' is used to encode / transcode videos to H.264 format.
  
  * 'mfxhevcenc' is used to encode / transcode videos to H.265/HEVC format.

  * 'mfxmpeg2enc' is used to encode / transcode videos to MPEG-2 format.
  
  * 'mfxjpegenc' is used to encode / transcode videos to JPEG format.

Requirements
------------

Software requirements

  * MediaSDK 2016 R1 for Yocto Embedded or
    Media Server Studio 2016 Professional R1 (Haswell / Broadwell)
  * GStreamer 1.4.x (up to including GStreamer 1.8):
  * GStreamer-Plugins-Base 1.4.x (up to including GStreamer 1.8):
  * CMake
  
  * Renderers:
      Wayland (>=1.7)
      X11 (DRI 3)
      EGL

Hardware requirements

  * Intel Apollo Lake
  * Intel Braswell
  * Intel Haswell / Broadwell

Compiling
---------

GStreamer-MSDK uses the CMake build tool to build the plugins.
Create a build directory within the source directory and run the CMake
command to configure the build.

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..

To make a debug build, please follow the command below:

	cmake .. -DDEBUG=ON
		

To build the plugin for Media Server Studio, please follow the command below:

	cmake .. -DWITH_MSS=ON
		

Next step is to compile the GStreamer-MSDK plugins:

	make

To install the plugins:

    	make install

The plugins will be installed in the /usr/lib/gstreamer-1.0 directory.


Usage
-----

 - Please refer to README.example_usage for usage instructions.

To do
-----

  * Playbin and text overlay support for decode and VPP plugins.


Acknowledgements
----------------

This project is heavily based on the well-established GStreamer VAAPI architecture, hence we would like to publicly thank the GStreamer VAAPI developers for their hard work and contributions.
